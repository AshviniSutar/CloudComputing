        <h2 class="title">Cloud Computing</h2>
           <p>Cloud Computing often referred to as “the cloud”, in simple terms means storing or accessing your data and programs over the internet rather than your own hard drive.
            Everything nowadays is moved to the cloud, running in the cloud, accessed from the cloud or may be stored in the cloud. Hence, the demand for Certified Cloud Architects is increasing across all sectors of the economy.</p>

                <p>Below is an image which shows the power of Salesforce in today’s tech-savvy world. From tech giants like Google and Facebook to your nearby call center, all of them use Salesforce services and products to solve their problems.</p>
                <div class="imgindex"> <img src="img/Salesforce.png" alt="" srcset="" class="indeximg"></div>
                <p>Salesforce started as Software as a Service (SaaS) CRM company. Salesforce now provides various software solutions and a platform for users and developers to develop and distribute custom software. Salesforce.com is based on multi-tenant architecture. This means that multiple customers share common technology and all run on the latest release. You don’t have to worry about the application or infrastructure upgrades – they happen automatically. This helps your organization focus on innovation rather than managing technology.   </p>
