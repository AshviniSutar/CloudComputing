        <h2 class="title">Importance of cloud computing for businesses</h2>
        <div class="skills-content">
            <div class="column">
              <h1>Flexibility</h1>
              <p> In recent years, many businesses are realizing how Cloud Computing is so important to be applied to the work environment of today. Even in a recent survey conducted by KPMG to 500 executives, it was found that 42% of them think that flexible work is the main factor why they use Cloud Computing. It offers greater flexibility to your employees in their work practices. If you need access to your documents and data while you are off-site or at home, you can interface with your virtual office, quickly and effortlessly whenever you need through any web-enable devices.</p>  
             </div>

            <div class="column">
              <h1>Cost Savings and Investment</h1>
              <p> Perhaps, one of the most remarkable benefits of Cloud Computing is certainly considerable savings in company’s IT costs. You do not need to spend for the purchase of inventory such as infrastructure and hard disk. You are only charged a low cost for regular compensation per month or once paid, according to the agreed service package with the Cloud Computing service provider. Thus, the royalty fees on automated software licenses are reduced, because they all run with Cloud-based computing.</p>  
             </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h1>Disaster Recovery</h1>
              <p>No matter the size, every business should be investing in durable disaster recovery, but for smaller businesses that lack the required budget and skills, this is often more an ideal than the reality. Cloud is currently helping more businesses avoid that pattern. According to one study, small companies are twice as likely as bigger companies to have implemented cloud-based backup and recovery solutions that save time, keep away from large up-front investment and roll up third-party expertise as part of the deal.</p>  
             </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h1>Collaboration Efficiency</h1>
              <p>Cloud Computing model enables your business to communicate and share more easily outside of the traditional methods. It allows better collaboration between employees, enabling multiple users to share and work on data and files at the same time. Cloud makes it simple for the company’s design and construction experts, who invest much of their time on job sites overseas or across various areas, to get work related information, documents and records quickly and in a secure way.</p>  
             </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h1>Scalability</h1>
              <p> Another major benefit of cloud computing is its scalability. Cloud-based services are ideal for organizations with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. Your business can scale up or scale down operation and the resource storage needs of your business may need quick adjustment to suit such variations, allowing flexibility as the needs change. If the needs increase, it’s easy to upsize your Cloud capacity, drawing on the service’s remote servers. Similarly, if you need to downsize again, the flexibility is baked into the service. The best way to scale up your business is using Cloud ERP. It’s easier and complete system.</p>  
             </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h1>Document Control</h1>
              <p> The more representatives and partners work together on documents, the greater the need for fastened document control. Before Cloud Computing, employees had to send files back and forth as email attachments to be worked on by one client at a time. At some point, you end up with a mess of colliding file content, formats and titles.</p>
